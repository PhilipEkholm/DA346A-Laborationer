 * Example:
 *	Bit 7-4 of PORTD should be set to 1010, while the
 *	rest of the register should NOT be modified! Usage:
 *		SET_BIT_LEVELS(PORTD, 0b00001111, 0b10100000);
 * The bit mask is used to clear the bits that should be modified. The bit
 * mask also protects the bits that shouldn't be modified.
